# Graduate-Admission-Prediction
This project aims to predict the chance of admission for students applying to graduate programs. Using a dataset of student profiles, I built and evaluated several regression models to estimate the likelihood of admission based on various features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, and more.


# Project Workflow

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and inspected the structure.
Cleaned the data by removing irrelevant columns and renaming the features for clarity.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features.
Modeling:

Linear Regression: Developed a baseline regression model.

Random Forest Regression: Applied a more complex model to capture non-linear relationships.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV for better performance.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics Used: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and RÂ² (R-squared) were used to evaluate the model's performance.
